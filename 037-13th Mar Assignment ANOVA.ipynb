    "- ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical method used to test the differences between two or more means.\n",

    "- The three main assumptions of ANOVA are:\n",
    "    ####\n",
    "    - Independence\n",
    "        - The observations within each group are independent of each other.\n",
    "        - The value of one observation does not affect the value of another observation.\n",
    "    - Normality\n",
    "        - The data within each group should follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "        - The data should be symmetric and bell-shaped.\n",
    "    - Homogeneity of Variance\n",
    "        - The variances of each group should be equal.\n",
    "        - The spread of data within each group should be similar.\n",
    "    - Absence of Outlier\n",
    "        - The outlying observations/data need to be removed from the dataset.\n",
    "####\n",
    "- Violations of these assumptions can lead to invalid results.\n",
    "- For example:\n",
    "    - Violation of Independence\n",
    "        - If the observations within each group are not independent, the results of ANOVA may be biased.\n",
    "        - For example, if measurements are taken on the same subject multiple times, the observations within that subject are not independent.\n",
    "    - Violation of Normality\n",
    "        - If the data within each group do not follow a normal distribution, the results of ANOVA may be invalid.\n",
    "        - For example, if the data are skewed or have outliers, they may not follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "    - Violation of Homogeneity of Variance\n",
    "        - If the variances of the groups are not equal, the results of ANOVA may be invalid.\n",
    "        - For example, if the variance of one group is much larger than the variance of another group, it may be difficult to detect significant differences between the groups.\n",
    "####\n",
    "- To check the assumptions of ANOVA, various diagnostic plots can be used, such as histograms, box plots, and Q-Q plots. If the assumptions are violated, alternative statistical methods may need to be used, such as non-parametric tests or transformations of the data."

    "        ####\n",
    "    2. Two-way ANOVA\n",

There are different methods to handle missing data in a repeated measures ANOVA, and the choice of method can affect the results and conclusions of the analysis.\n",
    "####\n",
    "- 1st Approach : Use Listwise Deletion\n",
    "    - Any participant with missing data on any of the variables is excluded from the analysis.\n",
    "    - This approach is simple to implement, but it can reduce the sample size and potentially introduce bias if the missing data is related to the outcome variable or the other variables in the analysis.\n",
    "####\n",
    "- 2nd Approach : Use Pairwise Deletion\n",
    "    - The available data for each participant is used for the analysis, even if some variables are missing for some participants.\n",
    "    - This approach retains more participants in the analysis but can introduce bias if the missing data is not missing at random.\n",
    "####\n",
    "- 3rd Approach : Use Imputation Methods to estimate the missing values.\n",
    "    - Imputation methods can include mean imputation, regression imputation, and multiple imputation. Mean imputation involves replacing missing values with the mean of the available values, while regression imputation involves predicting the missing values based on the relationship with other variables in the analysis.\n",
    "    - Multiple imputation involves creating multiple imputed datasets and analyzing each dataset separately, then combining the results.\n",
    "####\n",
    "- The choice of method to handle missing data should depend on the characteristics of the missing data and the assumptions of the analysis.\\\n",
    "- Imputation methods can be preferred if the missing data is missing at random and the assumptions of the analysis are met.\n",
    "####\n",
    "- Imputation methods can also introduce bias if the assumptions are not met or if the imputation model is misspecified.\n",
    "####\n",
    "- Conclusion\n",
    "    - Handling missing data in a repeated measures ANOVA is important to avoid bias and reduce the impact on the power of the analysis. There are different methods to handle missing data, and the choice of method should depend on the characteristics of the missing data and the assumptions of the analysis.\n",
    "    - Listwise deletion, pairwise deletion, and imputation methods are commonly used, and each has its advantages and disadvantages. Careful consideration of missing data is important to ensure the validity and accuracy of the analysis."
