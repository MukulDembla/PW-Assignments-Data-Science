    "- Outliers are data points that are significantly different from the other values in a dataset. These can affect measures of central tendency and dispersion in several ways:\n",
    "####\n",
    "- Mean\n",
    "    - Outliers can have a significant impact on the mean (average) of a dataset.\n",
    "    - A single outlier with a large value can shift the mean to be higher or lower than the \"typical\" value in the dataset.\n",
    "    ####\n",
    "- Median\n",
    "    - The median is less affected by outliers than the mean, as it is based on the middle value of the dataset rather than the sum of all values.\n",
    "    - However, extreme outliers can still affect the median, especially if they are located close to the middle of the dataset.\n",
    "    ####\n",
    "- Mode\n",
    "    - The mode is also less affected by outliers than the mean, as it is based on the most common value(s) in the dataset.\n",
    "    - However, if there are extreme outliers that occur more frequently than other values in the dataset, they can shift the mode to a different value.\n",
    "    ####\n",
    "- Range\n",
    "    - Outliers can increase the range of a dataset, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values.\n",
    "    - This can make it harder to interpret the spread of the data.\n",
    "    ####\n",
    "- Variance and standard deviation\n",
    "    - Outliers can increase the variance and standard deviation of a dataset, as they contribute to greater variability in the data.\n",
    "    - This can make it harder to interpret the variability of the data and to compare it to other datasets.\n",
    "####\n",
    "- For example, consider the following dataset of exam scores:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - [60, 70, 75, 80, 82, 85, 90, 95, 100, 110]\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The mean score for this dataset is 84, but the presence of an outlier (110) makes it higher than most of the other scores.\n",
    "    - The median score is 85, which is less affected by the outlier. The mode is 75, which is the most common value in the dataset but is also influenced by the presence of the outlier.\n",
    "    - The range is 50, but the outlier increases the variance and standard deviation of the dataset, making it more variable and harder to compare to other datasets."
