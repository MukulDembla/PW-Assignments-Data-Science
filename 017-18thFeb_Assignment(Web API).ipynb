    "    - Applications ensure automation through their inter-relationship and thereby resulting in a smooth transition of data.\n",
    "    ####\n",
    "  - Application\n",
    "    - As APIs can access the app components, the delivery of services and information is more flexible.\n",
    "    ####\n",
    "  - Efficiency\n",
    "    - When access is provided to an API, the content generated can be published automatically and is available for every channel.\n",

    "  - Security\n",

    "    - Once the API is compromised, all other applications and systems become vulnerable.\n",
    "    ####\n",
    "  - Cost\n",
    "    - Providing an API is expensive in terms of development time, ongoing maintenance, documentation and support.\n",
    "    ####\n",
    "  - Inconsistency\n",
    "    - In case you need to tweak existing code to add some extra functionality you might need to wade through layers and layers of files just to identify the line where you need to make any changes. It can get pretty annoying at times.\n",
    "    ####\n",
    "  - Time\n",
